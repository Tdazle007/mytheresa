# MYTHERESA CODING CHALLENGE


Good day sir,

Here is the read me for this project. Apologies for not providing a successful test. I did try to 
generate a successful offline test but none seem to work. I feel it is because of the dependencies i used.

I used the easyadmin dependency provided by symfony to carry out this challenge. A lot of files where git ignored
but i have gone ahead to upload to aid easy pulling and testing from your end.
The easyadmin dependency takes care of all the basic crud endpoints.

I have also attached the db dump to the App\migrations folder for reference. I hope i wasn't too
disappointing :(

Please sir, also remember to clear some cache before running the application. For this project
i feel the only tests that may be done may be a manual integration test but i may be wrong.

Thank you at least for taking the time to look at my submission. God bless sir and have a nice day.

Kind regards,

Tobore Ediri.
